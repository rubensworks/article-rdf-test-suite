## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Ensuring compliance of software libraries to certain specifications
is crucial for ensuring interoperability within the Semantic Web.
While many specifications publish their own declarative test suite for testing compliance,
the actual execution of these test suites can add a huge overhead for library developers.
<!-- Need         -->
In order to remove this burden from these developers,
<!-- Task         -->
we introduce a JavaScript tool called _RDF Test Suite_
that takes care of all the required bookkeeping behind test suite execution.
<!-- Object       -->
In this report, we discuss the design goals of RDF Test Suite,
how it has been implemented,
and how it can be used.
<!-- Findings     -->
In practise, this tool is being used in a variety of libraries,
<!-- Conclusion   -->
and it ensures their specification compliance with minimal overhead.
<!-- Perspectives -->
